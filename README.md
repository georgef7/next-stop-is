# next-stop-is
This is a passenger information display project.

Using Vite + React + MUI for the front end.
Backend TBD - A service will be created to contain route information (stops on the route), what is the next stop, door status, etc.

The display will show important information for the passenger, like the station name for the next stop, the route of the vehicle, final stop, etc.

A personal project by George F.
